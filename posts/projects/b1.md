**Fully Functional B1 Sumulator**

## Background

Out of the box, Unitree provides a high-level controller, [unitree_guide](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_guide) for the Aliengo, GO1/2 and A1 in gazebo and pybullet, but when trying with the B1 model...

...it doesnt work.

And it doesn't help that the Unitree Dev team has no plan for updating the B1 controller in the future ([github issue #80](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros/issues/80))

This simulator issues came after weeks of suffering to even communicate with the B1, solving problems like configuring the DNS and Default Gateways, communicating with Realsense Cameras, and performing surgery to replace a broken jetson NX module (taking out 216 screws with a allen wrench).

## Major Simulator Changes:

- Tune PID controllers, torques, and robot geometry to match B1 Specs
- Modify B1 URDF, adding support for Velodyne 3D Lidar
- Extend unitree_guide high-level controller to take arbitrary high-level commands over ROS
- Modify CMake Files to support compilation of all unitree robots on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04
- Read and publish data from D430i RealSense cameras
