            <p>
              Hawkvision is a computer vision project I developed during my
              time at the FIRST Robotics Team 2554.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of the project was to track a target marked with retroreflective tape. The camera that we used on
              the robot had a green ring light on it, so that the vision target appears bright green on the camera view.
            </p>
            <p>
              To track the targets, we used a program called <a
                href="https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP">GRIP</a> to build an OpenCV pipeline with color
              thresholds that narrowed out the vision target. We also calibarted the camera and found its focal length
              to determine the angle to the target.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this information, we were able to run a PID loop on the robot so that it could automatically align
              with the target on command.
            </p>

          <h3>Rocket Test Stand</h3>
          <div class="content">

            <p>
              Over the summer, I wanted to build and test custom solid rocket
              motors, so I built a test stand to measure the thrust of motors.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, I used a load cell along with an ESP 8266
              microcontroller, to read the load cell and transmit the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the code that runs on the ESP was written in C++ using the
              Arduino ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program on the ESP was responsible for reading the data from
              the load cell, storing the data in SPIFFS, sending data over TCP
              to connected clients, and broadcasting mDNS.
            </p>
            <p>
              An electron app was created to recieve and visualize the data.
              The electron app used mDNS to find the IP address of the ESP,
              and then recieved data on a TCP socket. It uses uPlot to graph
              the data in real time, and also records the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, it includes an interface to perform various functions
              on the ESP, such as starting/stopping data collection,
              downloading onboard data, and calibrating the load cell.
            </p>
